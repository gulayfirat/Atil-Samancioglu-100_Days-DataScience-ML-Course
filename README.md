# 📊 Atıl Samancıoğlu - 100 Days Data Science & Machine Learning Course

This repository contains the learning materials, code examples (Jupyter Notebooks), and projects from Atıl Samancıoğlu's comprehensive 100-day Data Science and Machine Learning course.

All topics covered during the training are organized into modules, with each folder containing the theoretical and practical applications of the corresponding subject.

## 🚀 Project Goal and Scope

This repository documents a learning journey aimed at acquiring the fundamental knowledge and practical skills necessary in the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning.

* **Fundamentals:** Python programming language and essential data manipulation libraries.
* **Data Analysis & Visualization:** In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
* **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Practical applications of Supervised (Regression and Classification) and Unsupervised Learning (Clustering) algorithms.
* **Data Preprocessing (Preprocessing):** Techniques for Feature Engineering, Handling Missing Data, Scaling, and Encoding.
* **End-to-End Project:** Reinforcement of learned knowledge through a real-world machine learning project (Diamond Price Prediction).
